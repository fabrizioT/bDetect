bDetect | bullet detection framework - Changelog
------------------------------------------------

-------------
Version: 0.66
-------------

* Internal code optimization (thanks Sickboy)

-------------
Version: 0.65
-------------

* Added "killed" event handler
* Renamed function bdetect_fnc_eh_fired_add() to bdetect_fnc_eh_add()
* Renamed variable "bdetect_skip_mags" to "bdetect_bullet_skip_mags"
* Fixed 3 typos ( "_x" instead of "_unit" ) in bdetect_fnc_eh_add()
* Removed initial 5 seconds wait time before framework initialization, since it's easy to code the wait outside of the framework
* Introduced variable "bdetect_fps_adaptation": (Boolean, Default true). Defines whether bDetect should try to keep FPS over "bdetect_fps_min", through degrading quality of detection
* Tweaks to code and example syntax

-------------
Version: 0.64
-------------

* Incorporated suggestions from tpw: http://forums.bistudio.com/showthread.php?136304-TPWC-AI-suppression-system&p=2182742&viewfull=1#post2182742
* Minor optimization / fixes
* Introduced variable "bdetect_callback_mode": (String, Default "spawn") Allowed values: "call" or "spawn". It controls synchronous vs.asynchronous bdetect_callback() execution.

-------------
Version: 0.63
-------------

* Reverted  to "time" from "diag_tickTime", for issues to be looked in

-------------
Version: 0.62
-------------

* Fixed bullet position handling

-------------
Version: 0.61
-------------

* Fixed problem with units eventually detecting own shots

------------
Version: 0.6
------------

* Incorporated v0.51 changes/fixes by tpw.
* Function bdetect_fnc_callback() slightly changed. See bottom of this file for example.
* Function bdetect_fnc_init() waits for 5 seconds to pass by after mission start, before activating the framework.
* Introduced function bdetect_fnc_eh_add(): suitable to force -immediate- assignment of a fired EH to any unit. Syntax: [unit] call bdetect_fnc_eh_add();
* Fixed function bdetect_fnc_benchmark(): internally using code spawning, not to block code execution after function call.
* Tweaked internals so that "diag_tickTime" is used instead of "time" (Thanks Ollem).
* Introduced function bdetect_fnc_eh_loop(): iteratively checks ( each "bdetect_eh_assign_cycle_wait" seconds ) for newly spawned units to assign them a 'Fired' event Handler.
* Renamed "bdetect_bullet_min_distance" to "bdetect_bullet_max_proximity"
* Introduced variable "bdetect_init_done": (Boolean). It evaulates true when framework is loaded. Usage: "waitUntil { bdetect_init_done};"
* Introduced variable "bdetect_eh_assign_cycle_wait": (seconds, Default 10). Wait duration foreach cyclic execution of bdetect_fnc_eh_loop()
* Introduced variable "bdetect_bullet_min_distance": (meters, Default 25). Bullets not having travelled this distance are ignored
* Introduced variable "bdetect_bullet_initial_min_speed": (meters / second, Default 360). Bullets initially slower than this are ignored (good for subsonic bullets skipping). 
* Introduced variable "bdetect_debug_chat": (Boolean, Default false) Show debug messages also in globalChat.
* Changed Variable "bdetect_debug_min_level" to "bdetect_debug_levels". (Array). Default [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]. 0-9 are reserved levels.

------------
Version: 0.5
------------

* Framework is named "bdetect" and contained into a single file: bdetect.sqf 
* Renamed variable "bdetect_debug" to "bdetect_debug_enable"
* Introduced variables "bdetect_name" and "bdetect_version": name and version of the framework;
* Introduced function bdetect_fnc_init() to handle the framework bootstrap.
* Introduced variable "bdetect_callback" (string). It defines the name of a custom callback function to be called on a unit when it detects a close bullet (Default: "bdetect_fnc_callback").
* Functions and variable names polishing. All vars named bdetect_<varname>. All functions named bdetect_fnc_<funcname>.
* Added some missing private vars.

------------
Version: 0.4
------------

* Introduced variables "bdetect_enable" (boolean), "bdetect_debug_levels" (Number), "bdetect_bullet_skip_mags" (array).
* Variable "bdetect_enable" act as a toggle to enable / disable framework.
* Variable "bdetect_debug_levels" allows for selective display / logging of debug messages based on level.
* Introduced function bdetect_fnc_benchmark() to display performance stats.
* Added "bdetect_bullet_skip_mags", which is a blacklist of bullet types which should not trigger detection

------------
Version: 0.3
------------

* Introduced variables "bdetect_bullet_delay" (seconds) , "bdetect_bullet_max_height" (meters).
* Variable "bdetect_bullet_delay" (seconds) changes dinamycally between "bdetect_bullet_min_delay" (lower bound) and 1 (upper bound), depending on actual FPS vs "bdetect_fps_min".
* Variable "bdetect_bullet_max_height" (meters) is the maximum height for bullets, over ground. Bullets higher than this value (Default: 10) and with up vector > 0 are skipped from detection, since they are too high and diverge from ground.
* Some Code optimization.

------------
Version: 0.2
------------

* Position of bullet as SetPosASL.
* Introduced variables "bdetect_fps_min" (fps), "bdetect_bullet_max_distance" (meters), "bdetect_bullet_max_lifespan" (seconds).
* Introduced function bdetect_fnc_diag_min_fps(): in case FPS go under "bdetect_fps_min" value (Default: 25) bdetect_bullet_delay is gradually raised. 
* Function bdetect_fnc_bullet_remove() edited and renamed to bdetect_fnc_bullet_tag_remove(), since actual removal is done elsewhere.
* Bullets are removed from bdetect_fired_bullets if distance is over "bdetect_bullet_max_distance" meters or lifespan is over "bdetect_bullet_max_lifespan" seconds.

------------
Version: 0.1
------------

* First draft
